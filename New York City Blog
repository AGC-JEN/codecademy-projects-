          New York City is made up of five boroughs: Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. 
          The city is home to approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York the Statue of Liberty, 
          which is located on Liberty Island and visited by tourists. It took 10 years to assemble and was unveiled in 1886. 
          Another tourist destination is Times Square, known for Broadway shows, neon signs, and large buildings. It was 
          named after The New York Times when the newspaper moved there; previously it was Longacre Square. NYC is also 
          famous for its bridges connecting the boroughs and facilitating transportation.
