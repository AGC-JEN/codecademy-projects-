1. Accessibility

âœ… You have alt attributes for all imagesâ€”excellent.

âœ… Semantic sections (<header>, <section>, <footer>) are used correctly.

ðŸ’¡ Optional improvement: Add aria-label or role="navigation" to <nav> for screen readers:

<nav role="navigation">
  <ul>...</ul>
</nav>

2. Responsive Design

Flexbox for .products and .team-members ensures cards wrap nicely on smaller screens.

The hero section uses padding, which works well, but consider adding a media query to reduce font-size on very small screens:

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .hero h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  .hero p {
    font-size: 1rem;
  }
}

3. Styling Notes

text-shadow on the hero heading is great for readability.

Using max-width and margin: 0 auto in .mission centers content nicely.

ðŸ’¡ You could add a little spacing between the section heading and the first paragraph for better hierarchy:

.mission h2, .team h2, #products h2 {
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

4. Hover States

You have hover for navigation links; consider adding subtle hover effects on product and team cards:

.product-card:hover, .member-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}


This adds a bit of interactivity.

5. Consistency

All section headings are center-aligned except .missionâ€”which is intentionally centered. Perfect.

Colors are consistent (blue for header/footer, white for cards), giving a clean brand identity.

6. Optional Enhancements

Back-to-top button: For long pages, a small fixed button improves navigation.

Smooth scrolling: Add this CSS:

html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}


Responsive hero image: Could add min-height or vh units:

.hero {
  min-height: 60vh;
}
