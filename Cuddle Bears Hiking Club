1. Semantic Structure

âœ… You are using semantic HTML: <header>, <section>, <footer> â€” great for accessibility and SEO.
âœ… Navigation uses <nav> with links to IDs, which is perfect for single-page scrolling.

ðŸ’¡ Optional improvement: Add role="navigation" and aria-label for screen readers:

<nav role="navigation" aria-label="Main Navigation">
  <ul>...</ul>
</nav>

2. Accessibility

âœ… All images have alt attributes.

âœ… Contrast between text and background is generally good (white on green hero, #333 on light background).

ðŸ’¡ Optional: Consider a slightly darker shade for hero text or adding a semi-transparent overlay to improve readability if the background image is very busy.

.hero::before {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
  z-index: 0;
}
.hero h2, .hero p { position: relative; z-index: 1; }

3. Responsive Design

âœ… Media queries for 768px and 480px ensure the layout adapts for tablets and mobile.
âœ… Flexbox for .gallery and .members ensures items wrap nicely on smaller screens.

ðŸ’¡ Optional: Reduce the gap slightly on very small screens to prevent excessive vertical scrolling:

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .gallery, .members {
    gap: 1rem;
  }
}

4. Styling

Variables (--primary, --secondary, --light) make it easy to maintain color scheme â€” excellent practice.

Cards (.member-card) have shadows and rounded corners for a soft, friendly aesthetic.

Hero section uses text-shadow for legibility â€” good choice.

ðŸ’¡ Optional enhancements:

Add hover effect to member cards for subtle interactivity:

.member-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}


Add smooth scrolling for in-page links:

html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

5. Minor Code Optimization

You have inline styles for some headings (<h2 style="text-align:center;">). Consider moving that into CSS:

#gallery h2 {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}


Keep image widths consistent using max-width as you have â€” good practice for responsive galleries.
