1. Fix Duplicate/Overlapping CSS

You have multiple global a selectors at the top:

{
  color: #2176FF;
  text-decoration: underline;
  cursor: pointer;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
}


The first block is missing a selector â€” it should likely be:

a {
  color: #2176FF;
  text-decoration: underline;
  cursor: pointer;
}


Also, later you have:

a {
  cursor: default;
  text-decoration-line: none;
}


This will override the first styles and remove the underline and pointer cursor for all links. Decide which style you want for links globally, or scope them to .nav-link, .activity, or other specific classes.

2. Navigation Markup

Currently:

<ul>
  <a class="nav-link">The Lodge</a>
  <a class="nav-link">Our Ski Runs</a>
  ...
</ul>


Best practice: <ul> should contain <li> elements, and <a> goes inside <li>:

<ul>
  <li><a class="nav-link">The Lodge</a></li>
  <li><a class="nav-link">Our Ski Runs</a></li>
  <li><a class="nav-link logo">The Summit</a></li>
  <li><a class="nav-link">How to Get Here</a></li>
  <li><a class="nav-link">Contact</a></li>
</ul>


This improves semantic HTML and accessibility.

3. Banner Section

You have overlapping text and a large <h2> inside the banner:

.banner h2{
  font-size: 120px;
  margin: -40px 0px 80px 0px;
}


Consider using relative units (em, rem, vw) for responsiveness.

Use position: absolute with text-align: center on .banner-text if you want to vertically center on different screen sizes.

4. Activities Panel

You are using <a> elements for the activity blocks without href. If these are not actual links:

<a class="activity">Skiing</a>


Better to use <div class="activity">Skiing</div> for semantic clarity.

Keep the hover/active effects with .activity:hover and .activity:active.

5. CSS Transition Improvements

You have transition applied to .activity:hover and .activity:active. Combine them for smoothness:

.activity {
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}


Then remove repeated transition from hover/active.

6. Responsive Considerations

Banner is height: 700px, large fixed height can break on mobile.

Use @media queries to adjust .banner, .banner h1, .banner h2, .activities-panel .activity width and font-size for smaller screens.

7. Footer

You have:

.footer h2{
  color: #ffffff;
  font-family: 'Raleway',sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 100;
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}


This is fine, but if you plan to add more info, consider using <p> or <address> tags instead of <h2> for accessibility.
